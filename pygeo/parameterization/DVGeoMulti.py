        Method that defines intersections between components.

        Parameters
        ----------
        compA : str
            The name of the first component.

        compB : str
            The name of the second component.

        dStarA : float, optional
            Distance from the intersection over which the inverse-distance deformation is applied on compA.

        dStarB : float, optional
            Distance from the intersection over which the inverse-distance deformation is applied on compB.

        featureCurves : list or dict, optional
            Points on feature curves will remain on the same curve after deformations and projections.
            Feature curves can be specified as a list of curve names.
            In this case, the march direction for all curves is ``marchDir``.
            Alternatively, a dictionary can be provided.
            In this case, the keys are the curve names and the values are the march directions for each curve.
            See ``marchDir`` for the definition of march direction.

        distTol : float, optional
            Distance tolerance to merge nearby nodes in the intersection curve.

        project : bool, optional
            Flag to specify whether to project points to curves and surfaces after the deformation step.

        marchDir : int, optional
            The side of the intersection where the feature curves are remeshed.
            The sign determines the direction and the value (1, 2, 3) specifies the axis (x, y, z).
            If ``remeshBwd`` is True, the other side is also remeshed.
            In this case, the march direction only serves to define the 'free end' of the feature curve.
            If None, the entire curve is remeshed.
            This argument is only used if a list is provided for ``featureCurves``.

        includeCurves : bool, optional
            Flag to specify whether to include features curves in the inverse-distance deformation.

        slidingCurves : list, optional
            The list of curves to project to, but on which the mesh nodes are not frozen in their initial positions.
            This allows the mesh nodes to slide along the feature curve.

        intDir : int, optional
            If there are multiple intersection curves, this specifies which curve to choose.
            The sign determines the direction and the value (1, 2, 3) specifies the axis (x, y, z).
            For example, -1 specifies the intersection curve as the one that is further in the negative x-direction.

        curveEpsDict : dict, optional
            Required if using feature curves.
            The keys of the dictionary are the curve names and the values are distances.
            All points within the specified distance from the curve are considered to be on the curve.

        trackSurfaces : dict, optional
            Points on tracked surfaces will remain on the same surfaces after deformations and projections.
            The keys of the dictionary are the surface names and the values are distances.
            All points within the specified distance from the surface are considered to be on the surface.

        excludeSurfaces : dict, optional
            Points on excluded surfaces are removed from the intersection computations.
            The keys of the dictionary are the surface names and the values are distances.
            All points within the specified distance from the surface are considered to be on the surface.

        remeshBwd : bool, optional
            Flag to specify whether to remesh feature curves on the side opposite that
            which is specified by the march direction.

        anisotropy : list of float, optional
            List with three entries specifying scaling factors in the [x, y, z] directions.
            The factors multiply the [x, y, z] distances used in the curve-based deformation.
            Smaller factors in a certain direction will amplify the effect of the parts of the curve
            that lie in that direction from the points being warped.
            This tends to increase the mesh quality in one direction at the expense of other directions.
            This can be useful when the initial intersection curve is skewed.
